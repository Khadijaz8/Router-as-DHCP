# Router-as-DHCP
A **router as a DHCP server** allows the router to automatically assign IP addresses and network information 
(subnet mask, default gateway, DNS) to devices on the network using the **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**.  

This eliminates the need for manual IP configuration on each device and ensures efficient, conflict-free IP address management.
